# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Record of Loz: A Fantasy Adventure

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A text-based fantasy adventure that allows the user to input commands to interact, similar to old computer text-based adventure games.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will tell a short interactive fantasy story in which at certain points, the user will need to input a command in order to progress the story as well as attain a certain outcome based on their command.
This would be done by using the input function for the user's inputs, and a list of actions would also need to be determined, and I think I would be able to accomplish this with a dictionary. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A fantasy adventure with a few commands and interaction outcomes and a simple short story 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The same, but with a better list of commands and more scenarios as well as a combat scenario.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A program that has a longer complete story and more content and situations overall. I would also want to have a party system that allows you to recruit at least two additional party members and have different outcomes based on their survival or recruitment.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I'll need to become skilled with at least streamlining some processes so that I don't just have an absurd amount of if statements as my main functions. I'll need to research some basic game design for this project.

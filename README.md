# I would say that a lot of the enjoyment and challenge for this final project was figuring out how to use boolean expressions to have different status effects occur in combat, such as defending or blinding. I'm sure the way I implemented it was much less intuitive than how you would usually go about doing that but it was still really interesting to work with. I was initially hoping to make the program a high-score based game based upon how many enemies the player can beat with limited health regenerationbetween encounters. Unfortunately, I was not able to accomplish this, but I am still satisfied with the basic combat system I created.

# Project Overview: https://youtu.be/3ZlCKQllrEw
# I would say that a lot of the enjoyment and challenge for this final project was figuring out how to use boolean expressions to have different status effects 
# occur in combat, such as defending or blinding. I'm sure the way I implemented it was much less intuitive than how you would usually go about doing that but it was still 
# really interesting to work with. I was initially hoping to make the program a high-score based game based upon how many enemies the player can beat with limited health regeneration
# between encounters. Unfortunately, I was not able to accomplish this, but I am still satisfied with the basic combat system I created.
